# ðŸŽ¨ **Introducing Real-Time Color Identifier Application.** ðŸŽ¥ðŸ‘†

I recently built a desktop application that uses computer vision to **identify and display the color at the center of your webcam feed in real-time**. Whether you're working with design, need quick color sampling, or just want to explore computer vision and Tkinter GUI, this project is a fun and practical tool.

The app also includes a **camera selector dropdown** for multiple webcam support and dynamically updates the UI to reflect the currently detected color. Useful for designers, developers, or anyone curious about colors around them. ðŸ’¡
